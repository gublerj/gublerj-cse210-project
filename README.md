# gublerj-cse210-project
# Final Project



# Requirements
The program may be any type of game or interactive simulation.
The program must use classes and objects.
The program must use the four principles of object-oriented programming.
The program must use the libraries chosen in the course.
The program must be delivered through a distributed version control system.
The program must be able to be run from the command line.
The program must be entered in the end-of-course contest.


Gather with your team and review the final project requirements Discuss the following questions during your meeting. Continue on when you've thoroughly addressed each one.
What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.

What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.

What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.

It's worth recognizing that you probably won't know everything about your program when you start. That's ok. In fact, it's expected. It's one of the real joys of programming. Each project is a journey of discovery and learning!
Create a plan to document your answers to the questions in step two. It's usually helpful to assign the documentation tasks by question and/or file (README, mockups, etc).
Document the project according to your plan. Use the docs folder of the project template to save your work. Be sure you use a branch-based workflow to integrate your invidivual work in a systematic way.
